      <h1>Getting Started</h1>
      <a id='1'></a><h4>1. Open a bank account.</h4>
        <p>The sooner the better! Choose a bank to open an account with. You may want to do some research on different banks first to make the right decision. Talk to them about opening a student account and you’ll be on your way to becoming a financial literacy guru.
        </p>
        
      <a id='2'></a><h4>2. Set a savings goal.</h4>
        <p>The general rule of thumb is to save 20% of your monthly income. However, as a student, a reasonable saving goal may vary. Perhaps you still rely on your parents for most purchases, which means that you may save around 80% of what you earn. On the other hand, you may not make much at your part-time minimum wage job, so a 10% saving goal might be best to account for your weekly nights out. Your savings should go into a savings account, which has an interest rate.
        </p>
      
      <a id='3'></a><h4>3. Explore ways of earning income.</h4>
        <p>There are endless ways to earn money, even as a student. Most people opt for working a job, since it is the most common and straightforward way to make money. However, never be afraid to explore your options, especially when the risks are still low. (Most students have a lot less to lose than adults when it comes to risking time and money) <span><a href='/making-money'>Click here</a></span> to explore the various ways to build your income.
        </p>

      <a id='4'></a><h4>4. Set spending budgets.</h4>
        <p>We all enjoy something money can buy, whether that be new clothes, good food, or video games. It’s more than okay to spend money on things that make you happy, but it’s important to be cognizant of how much you’re spending. Make sure you align your spending habits with your saving goals. Purchases can add up fast when you’re not careful.
        </p>

      <a id='5'></a><h4>5. Maintain a good credit score.</h4>
        <p>This is a term we’ve all heard of before, but we may not all know what it means. Your credit score is a measurement ranging from 0 to 900 that represents the risk associated with lending you money. The higher the number, the more reliable you are as a creditor. Although credit scores may not apply to you when you first open your bank account, it is important to understand the system and to keep it in mind in order to make good decisions in the future. <span><a href='https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/credit-reports-score/credit-report-score-basics.html' target='_blank'>Click here</a></span> to learn more about credit scores.

        <h1>Making Smart Choices</h1>
      <a id='6'></a><h4>1. Keep track of your money.</h4>
        <p>There are many great money-tracking apps out there. It’s important to keep note of your income and spending so you can see how money flows in and out of your account and how you can make adjustments to optimize your earnings and spending. 
        </p>
        
      <a id='7'></a><h4>2. Save and invest.</h4>
        <p>As mentioned above, you should be saving money in a savings account. However, you should also keep other types of investments in mind. If you are above 18, consider opening a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), into which you can set money aside and earn interest on it tax-free. You should also explore reliable stocks and index funds such as the S&P 500. <span><a href='https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/11/3-s-simple-investing.asp' target='_blank'>Click here</a></span> to learn more about investing.
        </p>
      
      <a id='8'></a><h4>3. Don't impulse buy.</h4>
        <p>You may really want those new shoes that came up on your social media feed, but is it a good idea to buy them right away? Give yourself time to evaluate the cost of the shoes and how much you will get out of them. Do you already have more than enough shoes to wear? Will you still like that style in a few months or years? Do you really want those shoes, or are you just bored? If after a few days or weeks you still think that it’s a good choice, go ahead with your purchase. If not, you just saved some money that can be better spent elsewhere.
        </p>

      <a id='9'></a><h4>4. Sharing is caring.</h4>
        <p>Need an online textbook for a class? Consider splitting the cost with a few classmates to save money. Need a nice dress for a one-time occasion? Consider borrowing or renting one rather than paying full price for something you know you’ll only wear once. Need to find a personal trainer, coach, or tutor? Consider finding a partner to take semi-private classes for a lower price.
        </p>

      <a id='10'></a><h4>5. Don't spend more than you can pay.</h4>
        <p>If you’re questioning whether or not you can afford it, you probably shouldn’t buy it. There are even companies like AfterPay that allow you to pay for goods that you purchase online in installments (for example, you have to pay a quarter of the product’s total price four times over the span of several weeks.) While this may be tempting at times you can’t pay upfront, it’s not a good idea to use their services. It’s not a good practice to be in debt to others, especially not as you get older and start using a credit card. <span><a href='https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/credit-cards/choose-credit-card.html' target='_blank'>Click here</a></span> to learn more about credit cards.
        </p>

      <a id='11'></a><h4>6. Sometimes it's better to spend more.</h4>
        <p>I know, I know, this sounds counter-intuitive. However, sometimes spending more money on a better quality product will save you money in the long run. For example, if you buy a cheap $10 backpack, it may only last a few months, and you’ll have to keep on buying new ones, but if you spend $60 on a good-quality, reliable backpack, it can last several years.
        </p>

      <a id='12'></a><h4>7. Invest in yourself.</h4>
        <p>Similar to the last tip, investing in yourself can end up saving you or making you more money. For example, you should buy a good mattress, since you spend a third of your day lying on it. This initial investment will pay off when you sleep well, prevent future back problems, and preserve your overall health. Furthermore, invest in your personal development. Education is crucial in life, so don’t be afraid to spend money on better-quality education as it can help guide you to future success. For example, investing in an online course may help you get a promotion or a new job that pays better.
        </p>

      <a id='13'></a><h4>8. Keep learning.</h4>
        <p>Financial literacy is a never-ending journey. Keep learning about how you can make better, smarter choices in your day-to-day life. You can find plenty of free resources online, but you already know that; you’re reading this on Schollar! <span><a href='/useful-links'>Click here</a></span> to find more finance-learning resources.
